supporters keeping it in the news [SEP] ill believe that when popefrancis meets with leaders of the lgbt community the pope sent a clear message by meeting with kimdavis [SEP] why are either of these

nut hugging for the pope anyway he is a sham and a douche same as all of them [SEP] not what she is claiming [SEP] takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be [SEP] kim davis makes my skin crawl [SEP] ask potus why does chicago his home town has very strict gun laws amp very high gun violence [SEP] 1 of the great things about this pope is he doesnt care about appearances maybe he was modeling peace amp forgiveness [SEP] thank god [SEP] well shes a very lucky person to have met him [SEP] of course its a form of support it just shouldnt have any impact on our political policies  he supported the death row inmate too [SEP] she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position its a small town so go figure kanyeshrug [SEP] hope he gave her a wtf about being divorced 3 times [SEP] many people meet with a pope apparently this was a blessing in dc he probably never heard of her then wham hes in a storm [SEP] all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth [SEP] too late what other reason would the pope have for a private meeting shes not even catholic [SEP] the face of mental illness being made famous [SEP] saw your status on facebook the other day [SEP] yes just like people do for imagrents [SEP] then what should it be considered unless he performed an exorcism on that witch it will be considered support getreal [SEP] a church desperate to look cool is a sad thing [SEP] she just needs to go away [SEP] kimdavis should have kept this meeting private bet thats what pope wanted shes using it to glorifypublicize herself more shameless [SEP] the vatican is has given in smh kimdavis has more guts and stronger in her faith than the vatican and it pope [SEP] popefrancis is a bullshitter [SEP] what is it then does catholic church support homosexuality does it conduct gay marriages [SEP] so what was it then trying to help the sinner stop homophobing a strategy session swapping culture war stories an affair [SEP] dont tell me that the vatican us telling a lie [SEP] its definitely support but the pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse so who really cares [SEP] then exactly how should the meeting be considered  shouldnt have met with kimdavis to begin with rewarded bad behavior [SEP] nor forgiveness [SEP] so what is it with god there is no sitting on the wall [SEP] with that meeting the pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was [SEP] buy this album if you love the pope [SEP] terrible to follow catholic doctrine by a pope seriously  [SEP] if he doesnt care about appearances why spin the visit it was ill conceived and looked terrible for pope [SEP] who ya gonna believe  me or the pope they lyin gaykentucky refreekimdavis [SEP] most assuredly not ms davis has a true commitment to god and his word the pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and  [SEP] too late for this [SEP] i stand with you kimgod be with you [SEP]  did he spank her  [SEP] so if all the military and police who protected him on his us  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok [SEP] you support or you dont sorry too many on the fence it broke [SEP] with how many of gods gay children did  meet in secret or public whether supportive or not [SEP] the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind find a solution to oregon like issues [SEP] important point is that he met with her and not gay groups gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage [SEP] so i assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage [SEP] millions of catholics wait a lifetime to share a moment with a popewhy herbecause the pope is a socialist who knows propaganda [SEP] maybe not but the pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from france to the vaticansays much [SEP] popeturd is back tracking already the pc police flexing their muscle again disgusting and people still worship this false idol [SEP] why would he meet with her anyway you lost me off my list [SEP] simply stop talking about her [SEP] funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be [SEP] he met with a gay couple the day before kim davis [SEP] then he shouldnt have met with her [SEP] doesnt matter why or what was said she will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia just like they do with abortion issue [SEP] no it should not [SEP] the vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho shes halfway there [SEP] pope met wher in support of her religious liberty amp conscience to put gods law above constitution which he made clear his position [SEP] he too pope will stand before god but wont be left standing repent of thy ways amp turn to god amp his ways kimdavis be encouraged [SEP] that is a lie and the vatican didnt say that homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians kimdavis [SEP] pope francis may have spoke against jesus christ but he is not stupid enough to take a stand on nonsense by the kentucky clerk [SEP] then how should we consider it a show of [SEP] 1kim davies is1 of d most courageous human i knowaloneshe stood publically to defend gods

she is doing they qualified it meaning they support some of it [SEP] he is a holy man giving comfort [SEP] i bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do i really have to talk to her [SEP] the people standing against gay marriage are the minority  46 is not a silent majority  less god more math [SEP] but what i heard on newsit seems it was a form of supportit was said
