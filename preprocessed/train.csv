[SEP] are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus no hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019ncov to protect yourself against the new coronavirus you should frequently clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water [SEP] once your hands are cleaned you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer [SEP] can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation [SEP] how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever ie have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus [SEP] however they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever [SEP] can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus no spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body [SEP] spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes ie eyes mouth be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations [SEP] do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus no vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus [SEP] the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine

health [SEP] can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus no there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus [SEP] there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections [SEP] can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus [SEP] does the new coronavirus affect older people or are younger people also susceptible people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus 2019ncov [SEP] older people and people with preexisting medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus [SEP] who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene [SEP] are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus no antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria the new coronavirus 2019ncov is a virus and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment [SEP] however if you are hospitalized for the 2019ncov you may receive antibiotics because bacterial coinfection is possible [SEP] are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus to date there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus 2019ncov [SEP] however those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care [SEP] some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners pls dont panic people with fake news because its

[CLS] how does covid19 spread people can catch covid19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid19 coughs or exhales [SEP] what are the symptoms of covid19 the most common symptoms of covid19 are fever tiredness and dry cough some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually [SEP] some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms and dont feel unwell most people about 80 recover from the disease without needing special treatment around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing [SEP] older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention [SEP] these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with  [SEP] covid19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick [SEP] can the virus that causes covid19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air can covid19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms [SEP] the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid19 experience only mild symptoms [SEP] this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill [SEP] you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid19 by taking some simple precautions regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water [SEP] why washing your hands with soap and water or using alcoholbased hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing why [SEP] when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus if you are too close you can breathe in the droplets including the covid19 virus if the person coughing has the disease avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why [SEP] hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and can make you sick make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene [SEP] this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze then dispose of the used tissue immediately why [SEP] droplets spread virus by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold flu and covid19 stay home if you feel unwell if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention and call in advance [SEP] follow the directions of your local health authority why national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility [SEP] this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections keep up to date on the latest covid19 hotspots cities or local areas where covid19 is spreading widely if possible avoid traveling to places  especially if you are an older person or have [SEP] diabetes heart or lung disease why you have a higher chance of catching covid19 in one of these areas for more information please contact us  email info bgghealthcare health healthy healthylifestyle healthcare coronavirus coronaturkey covid19 [SEP] ,nonrumour

[CLS] what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19 a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty amp huge consequences for long term impact  new paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially spoiler we still dont know value thread [SEP] human populations are not wellmixed amp homogenous so calcs give likely upper bound  q so what is herd immunity threshold hit for real pops a usually lower amp it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things 1 contact rates 2 susceptibility 3 infectiousness [SEP] background if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population herd immunity threshold hit for wellmixed homogenous population is simply 11r0  note r0 varies w behavior host traits environment so differs over timeampspace [SEP] 1 if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected lowering hit note variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread 2 if some arent susceptible to infection that reduces hit  3if some people dont transmit that also reduces hit [SEP] positive correlations among these traits  if individuals w more contacts are more susceptible and infectious  can make for very rapid changes in dynamics sadly not much empirical data on these correlations amp limited data on predictors of variation on susc amp infect [SEP] however see paper by  that is even better bc more general better data than science paper cited above fig shows how variation susc contacts affects hit f for r03 so hit066 f  094 [SEP] science paper link above also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals win each age group having more or fewer contacts [SEP] the strange part is that its not clear what source their agemixing data comes from the citation they give is not a published paper  its a link to a page w matlab files its weird because there are several agemixing datasets out there  can probably provide best ones [SEP] the take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age ie not wellmixed and w arbitrary differential activity contact rates win ages can reduce hit for r025 from 06 to 043 [SEP] the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept not an actual estimate of the most likely value [SEP] what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science its a extremely simple modeling exercise with arbitrarily chosen parameter values it isnt as general as  paper cited above and its not clear it has any new empirical data many older papers say same thing [SEP] paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity amp impacts on hit f based on data colored lines in figure [SEP] in idealized population early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak bc rtr0sn so rtlt1 however an epidemic will overshoot hit amp infect larger fraction f of pop where f1expfr0  for r025 reasonable for covid19 in some pops hit06 and f  089 [SEP] these simple calculations amp flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 4070 of pop would get infected without interventions most articles cited the 70  but  knew that [SEP] id like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity amp some are very indirect estimates but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial but  [SEP] serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f 20  i added horiz dashed line [SEP] together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is lt11r0 and epidemic overshoot ltf1expfr0 but by how much is still unknown ugh   smartly gave a wide range 4070 2060 in later interviews for fraction infected f wout interventions [SEP] unfortunately uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibilityinfectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for 1 pop amp it will vary among populations as does r0 the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection [SEP] are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence say gt 10 from the canonical immunity threshold aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups covid19 [SEP] yes see link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial [SEP] did some work on this in 2007 or so also when i recall correctly a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available [SEP] this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity ie a few important spreaders heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial [SEP] do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has how long it lasts [SEP] not yet sadly [SEP] without reading the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading [SEP] unroll please [SEP] salam please find the unroll here  what is herdimmunity threshold for covid19 a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty amp  talk to you soon  [SEP] what is this about nerd immunity [SEP] assumptions about heterogeneity are just that assumptions but there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns despite high levels of infection thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict [SEP] ,nonrumour

flu with both viruses the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised were fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu if were familiar with it its less scary to us [SEP] she notes because covid19 is so new theres little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine [SEP] ulmer says she doesnt know how many cases are in texas but mensah says there are 51 ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get essentially the common cold [SEP] im trying to get more info on this stat shes quoting i know thanks to thedaily i think that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia so mild is relative here [SEP] ulmer said shes hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to

for 37 days [SEP] ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces the virus is transmitted persontoperson she says that can include being in close quarters with someone simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets [SEP] thats why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing [SEP] ulmer said the health department is putting together soemthing so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case [SEP] im going to use tims first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling so  tim says the city wants to reduce

the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds the comment was at this time danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken 22 [SEP] tim says were not trying to

together to talk about the plans and practice them [SEP] we are as prepared as we can be with the information were getting of course its fluid but were accustomed to these types of situations [SEP]

for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us [SEP] now talking about flattening the curve people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections this is not here today and gone tomorrow feldschau [SEP] ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would tax our healthcare system should the citycounty get there it would have to look at alternative ways to treat people she didnt expand on what those alternatives are [SEP] she said thats one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up [SEP] i we know that youre coming the staff can be ready for you they can meet you outside they can give you a mask  thats one way now were trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 12 [SEP] as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus 22 [SEP] feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now

of it the science changes as we gather more data  thats to be expected [SEP] it would be helpful if  didnt use doublenegatives to get out important messages  notices thanks [SEP] kind of a double negative here in your 1st post are you saying it is ok to use ibuprofen  the 2nd post makes it seem like youre consulting physicians [SEP] i love ibuprofen no one should ruin its reputation  [SEP] it complicates the illness [SEP] how many double negatives can you have to make this more unclear to lessen understanding [SEP] question will this virus come in waves over the next 18 months like the 1918 influenza did [SEP] many effective alternatives to ibuprofen until further studies are forthcomingwhy take a chance [SEP] except for people with diabetes and hypertension there is research to indicate ibroprofen can exacerbate the uptake of the virus [SEP] thanks many governments seem to taken for granted that is is harmful though maybe is there no general agreement on this [SEP] why do you use ibuprofen when its not an antivirus [SEP] human pathogenic coronaviruses bind target cells together using angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which can be increased by treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii typei receptor blockers aka ibuprofen [SEP] consequently the increased expression of ace2 would facilitate infection with covid19 lei fang md phd postdoctoral researcher

stents who are taking baby aspirin acetylsalicylic acid or asa 81 mg please dont stop taking it because of covid19 fears 12 [SEP] 22 there is no evidence whatsoever that baby aspirin puts you at risk with covid19 [SEP] despite the double negative if you read the entire statement the gist of the  recommendation  can be understood  it is ok  to use ibuprofen if no other contraindications exist based on available information this seems to be very reasonable [SEP] based on currently available information is unhelpful its a very broad okay for a very specific question ibuprofen ibuprofene [SEP] it looks like a lab strain someone is trying to patent to have a science vendor sell its an attenuated virus meaning its a weakened form not able to cause infection we need these types of things to make studying the virus easier in a lab setting [SEP] thanks for the clarity ibuprofen is a commonly used drug so this helps [SEP] but for me my va primary does say to avoid ibuprofen amp naproxen sodium

even a twitch and they expect to do it again [SEP] in brazil this information is coming from blood banks which test every donation in rio de janeiro the antibody rate went from 4 in april to 14 in may and 28 in the beginning of june in the us the red cross should certainly have this info why isnt it available [SEP] thats a great point [SEP] antibody tests are important if for no other reason they still dont know how long the antibodies last andor resist reinfection  no one has yet to be able to answer that but i assume they are still testing to determine who knows [SEP] my bro works for a biotech company who makes covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly unlike influenza there should be lasting immunity which also means if enough people get it it will fade away completely just like sars and mers both coronaviruses [SEP] because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunitys work harris countys mask edict has just been extended until late

can be rushed to market [SEP] nih has been performing one results will be out in the next month or two [SEP] 112 n no a v [SEP] because reliable tests arent out there [SEP] alex be careful with antibody tests body deals usually so easy with the sars cov 2 that most of people dont even develop antibodies [SEP] is that when the often mentioned t cells come into the picture [SEP] im not sure what you mean but maybe i get some of it i believe that there are no coincidences ever so how is it that all the events happening are right on time for something how can the virus do what its doing very methodically and specifically at certain times and places [SEP] alex whats happening in nc  i live here and all i hear is gloom and doom  despite the numbers our own illustrious  dashboard tells us [SEP] great article  [SEP] new york city antibody results were over 20 two months ago i would expect that they are much higher now but there has been silence on that issue [SEP] assuming 20 positive on nyc antibody test that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from nyc alone [SEP] my guess is the real antibody results in nyc are much higher which is good news not bad news of course because it leads to herd immunity [SEP] its even more fundamental novo wuhan virus found in waste water samples in spain  in early 2019 the whole fauci narrative was bs from day one  the deaths are seasonal predictable and many are the result of malpractice [SEP] its irrelevant because by fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero they wont be able to hide that glaring fact [SEP] i suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming since it endangers the narrative [SEP] the cdc says for every 1 case we identified there were at least 10 we didnt  fauci claimed yesterday the us would see 100000 cases per day do the math  we have been well over his number for some time  we are now identifying those by testing people who arent ill [SEP] and two months ago they said thats what needed to happen more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms  now they are saying thats bad bad because well thats a lot of cases  i feel like we are being punked [SEP] nefarious they want this to continue or incompetence [SEP] pharmaceutical industrial complex [SEP] has fda eua approved covid 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities this will help identify those with antibodies [SEP] antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry molecular or microbiology field they will tell you the same thing [SEP]  new research from karolinska institutet and karolinska university hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic covid19 demonstrate socalled tcellmediated immunity to the new coronavirus even if they have not tested positively for antibodies [SEP] probably because theyre saying the tests are inaccurate  [SEP] what are you referring to in nc [SEP] fredericksburg va this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said theyre inconclusive and pointless [SEP] my wife and i did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving covid  it wasnt fun but almost everyone who get it survivesincluding almost every person in the us workforce  have politicized covid because restarting the economy helps trump [SEP] likely adding the number of positive  antibodies test results in with the covid positive results  its easier to fluff the numbers that way  cause it is all covid  [SEP] herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses just like it doesnt exist for influenza viruses it will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear my guess is the second one [SEP] it cant mutate and disappear bc literally natural selection also coronavirus family dont drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza [SEP] the red cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation hopefully that data will be aggregated and released [SEP] also i look forward to seeing this one on  in two weeks [SEP] well you live in ny  enjoy [SEP] while good news think weve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity [SEP] alex whats happening in nc havent seen any stats their website is not much help no actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies cc [SEP] the nc study is not randomized these volunteers are self selected i havent requested an antibody test because i dont think i have had the virus please stop calling it a randomized study [SEP] according to these swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x  nyc could easily be at 60 if they are right [SEP] what is happening in nc [SEP] its funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago [SEP] compare to other countries  if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us i dont think its that easy   in the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful [SEP] dude are you arguing herd immunity is achieved at 30 [SEP] nyc seroprevalence is around 25 and we see immunity playing a huge role not abolishing the virus as herd would but its ability to spread is extremely limited in ny [SEP] angry twitter man has found all the answers [SEP] arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days [SEP] and tcell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies  new york italy etc seems to show that were nearing herd immunity like it or not [SEP] not sure about doing things ny or italian style they basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for cv19 patients mental midgets [SEP] hundo p [SEP] i thought nih was doing this i volunteered but apparently was not selected [SEP] madness we are in the hands of luddites  cretins amp covidiotinchief [SEP] i think you are gonna be right  or close  but the evidence will be i think on worldometer or similar  deaths for sure are way down  lets see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon  i hope so [SEP] we will not see a widespread accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot [SEP] umno i dont know if you noticed but new york was a bit tense while all that was going on [SEP] confirmation for all the just wait two weeks ninnies karens and npcs they are gonna fight hard but keep sharing the data cant hide from the truth [SEP] it could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits [SEP] whats happening in nc what did i miss [SEP] why is  not demanding this [SEP] another day another article  now they say test for tcells and not for antibodies   for every person testing positive for antibodies two were found to have specific tcells which identify and destroy infected cells do we know what to test  [SEP] can you try to make these results available [SEP] and that would wipe out the pretext for mailin voting in november [SEP] gotta make it last to november then it will all go silent [SEP] we dont know because the cdc is not treating this viral disease like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance they are treating it like a political bludgeon clear data would hamper their mission [SEP] so what is the end game here who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic  the only semblance of  malice i can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame [SEP] antibody tests that are positive for antibodies is like having your own vaccine on board do more testing for antibodies viral tests when symptomatic covid19 covid19tx [SEP] can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me if its possible to have both t cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen or do the t cells if present automatically override cancel out the abs [SEP] did you see this study from karolina ka in sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people dont produce antibodies but produce an effective t cell immune response [SEP] remember when birx said on april 1 2020there is no more flu after that day any flu deaths were counted as covid we stupidly went along and believed anything they said [SEP] meanwhile arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved [SEP] might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing [SEP] you will never get that data the last thing democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out [SEP] they want us wearing bacterialladen petri dishes on our faces to make us sick so that in october when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell covid covid see its covid no voting in person close the polls [SEP] so i heard someone on oan news said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if its worse than that what if they are using manipulated test kits somehow its surely possible every other thing going on [SEP] this graph represents herd immunity  isnt this what we want [SEP] of course they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50 but not antibody testing  its like the media wants to propagate the scam as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the countrys popularity or something [SEP] the cdc has shown itself to be another incompetent self perpetuating government bureaucracy  random covid19 testing should have started in january 2020   without random testing you have no idea of whats happening   the cdc is clueless [SEP] so lets just let it spread and we will find out [SEP] hey dr  you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out  win those center moderate voters  keep up the great work  [SEP] ive been asking this the whole its odd [SEP] herd immunity would upset the plans mail in ballots fear for control vaccines for all contact tracing which really is the ground work for social score most of all marxist take over [SEP] they dont want this to endanything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedomand anything to get rid of trump [SEP] what is happening in nc  a little background of truth  nc is just now starting to test nursing home residents and workers in the facilities  just now  50 of nc deaths are from nursing homes [SEP] looking at the real stats [SEP] blame the idiot in chief trumpkillsus [SEP] if you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize isnt it the darkest before dawn [SEP] i hope you are right i want this over i cant take it anymore we are being scammed [SEP] the testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid  this whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate junk in junk out  open the country now [SEP] posting this again this seems to be correct [SEP] and this [SEP] they are all going to deny herd immunity until november 4 their followers are not exactly difficult to manipulate nj governor just paused indoor dining although covid burned out here months ago [SEP] explain the what is happening in nc is happening everywhere [SEP] earlier tonight there was a report that north carolina antibody testing showed 17

[SEP] the neighbours name is a sexual pun in swedish its a joke [SEP] its not real news it was from a swedish satire site [SEP] i doubt that this is true considering the fact that the neighbours name is hard on in swedish  [SEP] considering his neighbours surname translates to erection id agree that its a hoax [SEP] the neighbours name ståhfrääs actually means hardon but spelled as if it was a peers name [SEP] actually its not real gotta understand swedish to get it  [SEP] hmm according to this it isnt true  but i dont know what their sources are [SEP] do you think it could be murder [SEP]
