We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",

    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",
    "- You should build a **standard bigram language model**; i.e. do not do anything complicated like a bidirectional bigram language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "My first idea to improving the AI guessed from Q5 was to implement a trigram model, which did prove to be a challenge to keep track of all the dictionaries but I prevailed! It wasn't too complicated as it was pretty similar to the bigram model's concept. The difficult part was making it bidirectional. I created 3 new dictionaries (right_bigram_counts, left_trigram_counts, right_trigram_counts) to hold the counts for each respective model to implement the bidirectional aspect and just renamed bigram_counts to left_bigram_counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main ai guesser function, it first adds a \"$\" to the front and the back of the mask as the special starting and ending symbols which will be used to calculate the probabilities as well. It then removes all the already guessed letters. The rest of the code calculates and sums up the probabilities of each letter using a bidirectional approach (left and right context). This is done in the calc_prob function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calc_function has first (1 _ _), second (_ 2 _), current (_ _ 3) or current (1 _ _), second (_ 2 _), first (_ _ 3) depending on whether it is left or right context respectively (first is the furthest from current, second is the one next to current). The trigram model is only valid if a letter if second and first have been guessed and if there is at least one unguessed letter from the corpus that matches the given first the second. In a valid trigram model, if current has not been seen together with first and second in the corpus a add-one smoothing method is conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a trigram model is invalid, we switch to the bigram model, only considering second (_ 2 _), current (_ _ 3) or current (1 _ _), second (_ 2 _) for left and right contexts respectively. It has similar rules as the trigram one and an invalid bigram model defers to the unigram model. Outside the two for loops we also use the bigram models to calculate the probabilities of the first and last letters in the mask (excluding the beginning and ending special starting symbols '$')."
